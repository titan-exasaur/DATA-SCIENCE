# FAST API

Fast API is a RESTful API.

- **Request**: The frontend sends an HTTP request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to a specific URL (endpoint) defined by the API, possibly including data in a format like JSON.
    * GET - Get some information
    * POST - Create somthing new
    * PUT - Update info
    * DELETE - Delete some info
- **Processing**: The backend server receives the request, processes the necessary logic (e.g., querying the database, verifying credentials), and generates a response.
- **Response**: The backend sends a response back to the frontend, typically containing the requested data (in JSON format) and a status code (e.g., "200 OK" for success).
- **UI Update**: The frontend receives the response and uses the data to update the user interface dynamically, without requiring a full page reload.
